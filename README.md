### About the project

To-Do list in The Odin Project is known as a very heavy and complicated/long project. It involves quite a lot of planning, and implementing features as well as the basic framework is not an easy task. Starting from webpack, to the starting classes working for my Tasks and Projects, sorting each task into projects, then furthuring that by getting the correct DOM manipulation for all of the above and adding localStorage functionality.

After gettting this basic functionality there were many features that I wanted to add. Some of those included being able to edit tasks correctly, sort by priority, dynmically update done tasks and task priority, display tasks by those not completed, sort by tasks due in the week and tasks due today. I also wanted to ability to add tasks not in a project and edit project names easily, hence the "all" tasks tab. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the result and what I was able to implement.

### Objectives

- [x] Successfully setup webpack
- [x] Brainstorm and plan what the project framework should look like
- [x] Think correctly about how each module will work together and how the projects will correlate with tasks
- [x] Include certain properties of the task such as: title, description, dueDate, priority, notes, and complete status
- [x] Sort tasks into their respective projects and a default project
- [x] Create classes for tasks and projects, then create a different module for how tasks are sorted.
- [x] Display all information on DOM correctly and have it dynmically update based on user interaction
- [x] Use external library with NPM (date-fns) to find an easier way to handle and format dates for each task
- [x] Read on and implement localStorage correctly so all projects and tasks are stored per device. (Also if there is no localStorage have default tasks desplayed)
- [x] Implement final features for a better user experience such as edit tasks, delete tasks and projects, view all tasks, sort tasks by priority, dynamically update tasks that are completed, get details on tasks and much more!

### What I learned and What I would do differently

- I learned **alot** when tackling this monster of a project. The hardest and most difficult part that I had really yet to have to do was _planning_. Going into it, I was unaware of how much planning actually went into this project. I had a brief idea of what I wanted to do and how I wanted to accomplish it which helped me get a good start.
- As the project got bigger and bigger though, I would have to take a step back and really thinnk about _how_ I want to implement this next feature, and how it relates to other parts of the project.
- I was able to also learn a ton about localStorage, this was something I had never had to do before and took quite a bit of research and messing around with. With a day of work though, I was able to successfully implement it which was super exciting!
- With such a large project, it was much harder to keep my modules separate. This is something I wish I could have done better, the code itself seems to be organized to _me_ but if someone else looked at it, it may not be as clear. There are a few dependencies that I wish I could have avoided, but overall I feel as if the code organization for my first big project really was not terrible and the way everything works together is pretty clear!
- Im overall happy with the project that I was able to create. It definitely was not easy, but I learned so much from it! Learning the importance of concise planning was probably my biggest takeawa.
- Creating features that separate the DOM from the logic isnt always easy but its how you accomplish it thats important!
- Overall, Im very happy with my result but also happy to be done! Hope you enjoy my To-Do List Project!
